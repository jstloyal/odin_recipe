    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
        Gnocchi originate in Northern Italy, where the colder climate rendered great potatoes, but poorer quality grain. <br>
         That being said, the use of potato in Italian cuisine is a relatively recent development, since potatoes were only <br>
          introduced to Europe in the 16th century. Prior to this, a rudimentary version of gnocchi was made from ingredients <br>
         like zucca (meaning squash) and breadcrumbs, known as pangrattato in the native tongue. These ingredients were common in
         <br>the diet of peasants, and their sum was both filling and inexpensive to produce.
    </p>
    <p>Gnocchi, pronounced ‘n(y)oh-kee’ (singular ‘gnocco’), are a type of pasta consisting of soft, <br>
        fat and chewy dumplings, typically paired with ragú, tomato or butter sauce. <br>
        Traditionally, gnocchi dough is made of semolina or plain wheat flour, egg, and mashed potato. <br>
         That being said, gnocchi ingredients may vary, with the additional ingredients or substitutions including cheese, <br>
         vegetables, and herbs. Once the dumplings are formed, they are often pressed against a fork, or traditional gnocchi board, <br>
         to form ridges that improve gnocchi’s ability to adhere to sauce, and create the signature gnocchi shape. Alternatively, the gnocchi are left as smooth-edged lumps.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Pork sausages</li>
        <li>Chilli flakes</li>
        <li>Fennel seeds</li>
        <li>Fresh Gnocchi</li>
        <li>Chicken stock</li>
        <li>Chopped kale</li>
        <li>Permesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps (Methods):</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in a large high-sided frying pan over a medium heat. Squeeze the sausages straight from their skins into the pan, <br>
            then use the back of a wooden spoon to break the meat up. Sprinkle in the chilli flakes and fennel seeds, if using, then fry until <br>
            the sausagemeat is crisp around the edges. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tip the gnocchi into the pan, fry for a minute or so, then pour in the chicken stock. Once bubbling, cover the pan with a lid and cook for 3 mins, <br>
             then stir in the kale. Cook for 2 mins more or until the gnocchi is tender and the kale has wilted. Stir in the parmesan, then season with black <br>
              pepper and scatter the crisp sausagemeat over the top.
        </li>
